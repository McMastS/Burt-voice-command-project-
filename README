Hello and welcome to BURT! BURT is our "smart" speaker.
BURT uses wit.ai to parse speech files and run commands.

Make sure to have libcurl-dev and libjsoncpp-dev installed
To compile and run tests use (from main project folder):
g++ ./test/test.cpp -lcurl -ljsoncpp -lwiringPi
./a.out

Refer to the Expected Output.txt file for a sample output.

If you make your own .wav files to test, make sure they are recorded using mono, not stereo.
If you would like a demo of the lights, let us know.
